I am a graduating senior studying Computing Security student at Rochester Institute of Technology. When not in class, I enjoy attending RITâ€™s two security clubs, RC3 (RIT's Competitive Cyber Security Club) and SPARSA (Security Practices and Research Student Association). Additionally, I love participating in CTFs with the interest group I started, Team Contagion. I also take great interest in participating in Attack/Defend competitions as well as researching any security related topics that pique my interest.
