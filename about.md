I am a Senior Security Engineer and alumnus of Rochester Institute of Technology. While in school, I enjoyed attending RITâ€™s two security clubs, RC3 (RIT's Competitive Cyber Security Club), and SPARSA (Security Practices and Research Student Association). Additionally, I love participating in CTFs with the interest group I started, Team Contagion. I also take great interest in participating in Attack/Defend competitions as well as researching any security-related topics that pique my interest.
